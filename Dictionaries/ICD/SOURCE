International Classification of Diseases (ICD)

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the standard diagnostic
tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes. This includes
the analysis of the general health situation of population groups. It is used
to monitor the incidence and prevalence of diseases and other health problems.

It is used to classify diseases and other health problems recorded on many
types of health and vital records including death certificates and health
records. In addition to enabling the storage and retrieval of diagnostic
information for clinical, epidemiological and quality purposes, these records
also provide the basis for the compilation of national mortality and morbidity
statistics by WHO Member States. It is used for reimbursement and resource
allocation decision-making by countries.

ICD-10 was endorsed by the Forty-third World Health Assembly in May 1990 and
came into use in WHO Member States as from 1994. The 11th revision of the
classification has already started and will continue until 2015.
